\f2\i \cf2 The False Light That Fades \
\pard\pardeftab720\partightenfactor0

\f1\i0 \cf2 A Biblical Theology of Deception and the Accuser\'92s Mirage\
\
Throughout Scripture, false light is presented as a seductive force, drawing humanity away from the true illumination of God and into illusion, idolatry, and self-deception. Often appearing as wisdom or enlightenment, this false light fades, ultimately revealing its emptiness when confronted with the eternal light of Christ.\
\
This study explores the Hebrew and Greek roots of false light, its deceptive patterns in Scripture, and how Jesus Christ exposes all counterfeit glories with the unfading light of truth.\
