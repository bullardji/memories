\f2\i0 \cf2 A Primer on the Divine Order of the Spirit in the Church\
\
The Acts 15 Cosmologica-Pneumatic Key Frame describes a theological framework rooted in the Jerusalem Council of Acts 15, where the apostles discerned the Spirit\'92s activity among the Gentiles. This moment reveals a cosmological order for the inclusion of the nations into the covenant of grace, establishing a pattern of spiritual discernment, authority, and unity under the Word of God.\
\
This key frame bridges the Old Testament prophetic promises with the New Covenant reality in Christ by using pneumatology (the study of the Holy Spirit) to reveal divine governance within the Church. It models a spiritual geometry where law, grace, and prophecy meet in a cosmic balance of truth and mercy.\
\
I. Defining the Cosmologica-Pneumatic Key Frame\
\
The Cosmological Order refers to the divinely revealed structure of creation and covenant:\
	\'95	Cosmos (
\f3 \uc0\u954 \u972 \u963 \u956 \u959 \u962 
\f2 ) 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  The ordered world, governed by divine wisdom.\
	\'95	Pneuma (\uc0\u960 
\f3 \uc0\u957 \u949 \u8166 \u956 \u945 
\f2 ) 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  The Holy Spirit as the divine life-giver and revealer of truth.\
\
The Acts 15 Key Frame reveals how the Spirit interacts with creation, covenant, and community in three layers:\
\
II. The Three Layers of the Acts 15 Key Frame\
\
1. Cosmological Layer (The Order of God\'92s Creation)\
	\'95	Rooted in Genesis 1 and the Law of Moses (Acts 15:21).\
	\'95	Physical Root: Creation was ordered with distinctions and boundaries (clean/unclean, Israel/nations).\
	\'95	Key Phrase: \'93Known to God from eternity are all His works.\'94 (Acts 15:18)\
	\'95	Key Frame: Divine design and moral law are grounded in creation order.\
\
2. Pneumatic Layer (The Movement of the Spirit)\
	\'95	Rooted in the outpouring of the Spirit at Pentecost and the Gentile conversion of Cornelius (Acts 10).\
	\'95	Key Insight: The Holy Spirit moves outside the boundaries of the Mosaic Law, yet fulfills it.\
	\'95	Physical Manifestation: Signs, wonders, and the Gentiles receiving the Spirit.\
	\'95	Key Verse: \'93God gave them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us.\'94 (Acts 15:8)\
\
3. Covenantal Layer (The Fulfillment of the Prophetic Word)\
	\'95	Rooted in the prophets, especially Amos 9:11-12, quoted by James (Acts 15:16-17).\
	\'95	Key Insight: The restored tent of David symbolizes the Messianic Kingdom, where the Gentiles are included under Christ\'92s reign.\
	\'95	Key Verse: \'93So that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord.\'94 (Acts 15:17)\
\
III. The Triadic Structure of the Acts 15 Key Frame\
\
The cosmologica-pneumatic frame reveals a triadic pattern in divine governance:\
\
Cosmological	Pneumatic	Covenantal\
Law and Creation Order	Spirit\'92s Revelation and Movement	Prophetic Fulfillment\
Distinctions (Jew-Gentile)	Unity in the Spirit	David\'92s Tent Restored\
Moses and Torah	Signs and Gifts of the Spirit	Christ as Fulfillment\
\
IV. Key Frames in Action: The Jerusalem Council as a Triadic Event\
\
The Jerusalem Council itself is a triadic moment of cosmic importance:\
	1.	Peter\'92s Testimony (Pneumatic Witness) 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  \'93The Holy Spirit fell upon them just as upon us.\'94 (Acts 15:8)\
	2.	James\'92 Prophetic Insight (Covenantal Witness) 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  Amos 9 and the restoration of David\'92s Tent.\
	3.	The Written Decision (Cosmological Authority) 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  A binding decree reflecting God\'92s order for the Church.\
\
V. Key Theological Anchors in Acts 15\
\
1. Divine Inclusion Without Abandoning Order:\
	\'95	The Gentiles receive the Spirit without circumcision, yet moral boundaries remain (Acts 15:29).\
	\'95	Balance of Freedom and Form: The Spirit moves beyond the Law while affirming its eternal principles.\
\
2. The Restoration of David\'92s Tent:\
	\'95	David\'92s Tent (Amos 9) symbolizes a worshiping community gathered under Messianic reign.\
	\'95	This prophetic image connects temple, worship, and kingdom into one reality fulfilled in Christ.\
\
3. Pneumatic Discernment and Apostolic Authority:\
	\'95	The Spirit\'92s movement requires apostolic confirmation.\
	\'95	The Council represents divinely guided human governance within the Church.\
\
VI. Hermeneutical Application: How to Use the Acts 15 Key Frame in Biblical Study\
\
Step 1: Identify the Root Structure (
\f4 \uc0\u9881 \u65039 
\f2 )\
	\'95	Examine the cosmological order of the text: Are there boundaries or distinctions being addressed?\
\
Step 2: Identify Pneumatic Activity (
\f4 \uc0\u55356 \u57088 
\f2 )\
	\'95	Look for the Spirit\'92s movement and revelation: How does the Spirit reveal truth beyond natural observation?\
\
Step 3: Identify Covenant Fulfillment (
\f4 \uc0\u55358 \u56809 
\f2 )\
	\'95	Examine how prophetic texts are reframed for New Covenant reality.\
\
VII. Practical Application in Christian Life and Governance\
\
1. Church Governance and Authority:\
	\'95	The Acts 15 model reveals that apostolic leadership works through both the Spirit and Scripture.\
	\'95	Decisions should balance Spirit-led discernment and Scriptural faithfulness.\
\
2. Personal Faith and Moral Boundaries:\
	\'95	The Spirit\'92s freedom does not negate holiness but clarifies it.\
	\'95	\'93It seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us\'85\'94 (Acts 15:28)\
\
3. Mission and Evangelism:\
	\'95	The inclusion of the Gentiles models the Great Commission (Matt. 28:18-20).\
	\'95	The Gospel breaks down ethnic and cultural barriers without erasing creational distinctions.\
\
VIII. Theological Significance of the Acts 15 Key Frame\
\
The Acts 15 Cosmologica-Pneumatic Key Frame serves as a spiritual blueprint for:\
	\'95	Unity in Diversity: One Spirit, multiple cultures.\
	\'95	Freedom with Form: The Spirit works within divine order.\
	\'95	Prophetic Fulfillment: The Old Testament is fulfilled, not abolished.\
\
This Key Frame reminds the Church that:\
	\'95	God\'92s order is eternal.\
	\'95	The Spirit\'92s work continues.\
	\'95	Christ\'92s reign is now.\
\
IX. Why This Matters for Biblical Literacy and Leadership:\
\
The Acts 15 Cosmologica-Pneumatic Key Frame is essential for:\
	\'95	Biblical Interpretation: Balancing law, grace, and the Spirit\'92s freedom.\
	\'95	Ecclesiology: Clarifying church authority and unity.\
	\'95	Missiology: Confirming the universal mission of the Gospel.\
