\f2\i0 \cf2 A Fractal Framework of Biblical Revelation\
\
\'93The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.\'94 (Revelation 19:10)\
\
The Petals of Prophecy is a fractal biblical framework for understanding how divine revelation unfolds in progressive layers\'97like the blossoming of a flower. Each prophetic word in Scripture forms part of a composite whole, spiraling outward from Genesis to Revelation, each layer expanding but never contradicting the truths beneath.\
\
Solomon\'92s poetic wisdom, Isaiah\'92s messianic clarity, Ezekiel\'92s symbolic depth, and John\'92s apocalyptic vision all spiral together as petals on the same prophetic flower, pointing to the unfolding of Christ in every age.\
\
I. The Seed Core: Prophecy Rooted in the First Word\
\
At the center of the Petals of Prophecy lies the Seed of the Word itself:\
	\'95	Genesis 1:3: \'93Let there be light.\'94\
	\'95	Genesis 3:15: \'93The Seed of the woman shall crush the serpent\'92s head.\'94\
\
The Root Principle:\
	\'95	All prophecy originates in God\'92s self-revelation in creation.\
	\'95	Prophecy is not prediction but truthful revelation about the present with future fruit.\
\
Prophecy is the unveiling of eternal truth hidden in time.\
\
II. The First Petal: Prophecy as Covenant Revelation\
\
Hebrew Root: 
\f3 \uc0\u1504 \u1464 \u1489 \u1460 \u1497 \u1488

\
Key Prophetic Pattern:\
	\'95	Abraham (Genesis 15) \'96 Covenant Promises.\
	\'95	Moses (Exodus 20) \'96 Covenant Law.\
	\'95	David (2 Samuel 7) \'96 Covenant Kingship.\
\
Theological Pattern:\
	\'95	The first petal reveals God\'92s promises expanding from a single word into a nation, a king, and a people.\
\
III. The Second Petal: Prophecy as Warning and Calling Back\
\
As the flower expands, prophecy shifts to confrontation and restoration.\
\

	\'95	Physical Root: To remove a covering.\
\
Prophetic Pattern:\

\
V. The Fourth Petal: Prophecy Fulfilled in Christ\
\
The Gospels reveal the full blossoming of prophecy:\
\
Matthew 5:17: \'93I have not come to abolish the Law and the Prophets, but to fulfill them.\'94\

	\'95	Paul: Explains the mystery of Gentile inclusion (Ephesians 3).\
	\'95	John: Unveils final cosmic realities (Revelation 1).\
\

\f2  (proph\uc0\u275 teia) \'96 Speaking forth under divine influence.\
\
Theological Shift:\
	\'95	Prophecy moves from national Israel to a global kingdom.\
\

Covenant Prophecy	The Seed	Reveals the Promise	Jesus as the Promised Seed (Gal. 3:16)\
Warning Prophecy	The Branch	Calls for Repentance	Jesus as the Righteous Branch (Jer. 23:5)\
Apocalyptic Prophecy	The Flame	Reveals Heavenly Mysteries	Jesus as the Light of the World (John 8:12)\
\
IX. Practical Application: How to Read Scripture Through the Petals of Prophecy\
	1.	Look for Layers:\
	\'95	Prophecy echoes in patterns, not isolated events.\
	2.	Trace the Bloom:\
	\'95	From Genesis to Revelation, the flower expands and completes.\
	3.	Focus on Christ:\
	\'95	All prophecy points to Jesus as the final fulfillment.\
\
X. Conclusion: Prophecy as a Living Word\
\
The Petals of Prophecy reveal that all Scripture is a single unfolding revelation:\
	\'95	The Seed: God\'92s first Word.\
	\'95	The Bloom: Christ\'92s fulfillment.\
	\'95	The Full Flower: The new creation yet to come.\
\
Prophecy is not obscure predictions but the art of divine revelation, calling the soul to see both the now and the not yet through the Word Made Flesh.\
