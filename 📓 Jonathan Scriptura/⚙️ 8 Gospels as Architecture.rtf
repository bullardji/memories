\f1\i\b0 \cf2 The Four Proper Gospels as Narrative Architecture
\f2\i0 \
Seeding the Tetra-Meta of Philosophi-Histori-Poetri-TruLore\
\
The Four Gospels\'97Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John\'97are more than historical records or theological treatises. They are a narrative architecture, intentionally woven together to establish a tetradic seed matrix of truth, wisdom, and reality in Word and Story.\
\
This Tetra-Meta structure, rooted in fourfold witness, extends beyond mere biography into cosmic storytelling. It is philosophical, historical, poetic, and revelatory\'97a complete meta-framework for knowing God and His self-disclosure in Jesus Christ.\
\
This primer will outline how the fourfold Gospel creates a narrative architecture for all biblical truth, embedding TruLore\'97the living legacy of Scripture\'97as a generational inheritance for faithful storytelling and spiritual wisdom.\
\
I. The Tetra-Meta Structure of the Four Gospels\
\
The four Gospels correspond to four distinct lenses for revealing the fullness of divine reality. Each Gospel plays a unique role in constructing the complete narrative architecture:\
\
Gospel	Key Lens	Focus	Emblem\
Matthew	Philosophic Wisdom	Fulfillment of Prophecy	The Human Face\
Mark	Historical Urgency	Kingdom Action and Power	The Lion\
Luke	Poetic Compassion	Universal Good News for All	The Ox (Service)\
John	Revelatory Mystery	Theological Depth and Logos	The Eagle (Vision)\
\
II. The Gospels as Philosophi-Histori-Poetri-TruLore\
\
The Gospels were not randomly arranged but divinely designed as a fourfold symphony of:\
\
1. Philosophi (Matthew) \'96 Wisdom and Law\
	\'95	Structure: Built as a catechism with five discourses.\
	\'95	Key Phrase: \'93That it might be fulfilled\'85\'94\
	\'95	Purpose: To teach Christ as the New Moses, the Wisdom Incarnate.\
	\'95	TruLore Insight: Matthew plants doctrine for the formation of covenantal thought.\
\
2. Histori (Mark) \'96 Time and Action\
	\'95	Structure: Immediate, urgent, fast-moving.\
	\'95	Key Phrase: \'93Immediately\'85\'94\
	\'95	Purpose: To declare Christ\'92s authority in time and space.\
	\'95	TruLore Insight: Mark frames the epic conflict between kingdoms with historical precision.\
\
3. Poetri (Luke) \'96 Song and Inclusion\
	\'95	Structure: Narrative Parables, Hymns of Praise.\
	\'95	Key Phrase: \'93Rejoice\'85for I bring you good tidings!\'94\
	\'95	Purpose: To celebrate Christ as the Savior of all peoples, especially the marginalized.\
	\'95	TruLore Insight: Luke weaves personal stories into the grand epic, focusing on mercy and healing.\
\
4. TruLore (John) \'96 Logos and Theophany\
	\'95	Structure: Mystical Seven Signs, **\'93I Am\'94 Statements.\
	\'95	Key Phrase: \'93In the beginning was the Word\'85\'94\
	\'95	Purpose: To unveil Christ as the Eternal Logos, God made manifest.\
	\'95	TruLore Insight: John bridges heaven and earth, revealing the mystical center of all Scripture.\
\
III. The Fourfold Seed as a Narrative Architecture\
\
The Gospels create a seed pattern where each Gospel:\
	\'95	Echoes the Old Testament (esp. Torah and Prophets).\
	\'95	Completes the Revelation of Christ.\
	\'95	Initiates the New Testament Church.\
\
The Tetra-Meta emerges as a cosmic key for biblical understanding, like the four rivers of Eden or the four creatures around God\'92s throne (Rev. 4:7).\
\
This architecture reveals four anchors in divine revelation:\
	\'95	Creation (John)\
	\'95	Covenant (Matthew)\
	\'95	Kingdom (Mark)\
	\'95	Redemption (Luke)\
\
IV. The Seed Theory: Planting the Tetra-Meta for Future Growth\
\
The Gospels function not merely as accounts but as seed texts designed to reproduce theological fruit:\
	1.	Seeds of Wisdom: Matthew\'92s teaching style instructs discipleship.\
	2.	Seeds of Action: Mark\'92s urgency stirs faith and mission.\
	3.	Seeds of Compassion: Luke expands the covenant outward.\
	4.	Seeds of Mysticism: John draws the heart into divine mystery.\
\
V. The Fourfold Gospel as Triadic Framing and Interplay\
\
The Four Gospels do not exist independently but interlock with triadic relationships:\
	\'95	Synoptic Flow: Matthew 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  Mark 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  Luke share common historical ground.\
	\'95	Johannine Overlay: John expands the metaphysical depth.\
	\'95	Pauline Anchor: The Gospels feed the apostolic writings.\
\
VI. The Tetra-Meta as a Key for Theological Understanding\
\
The Fourfold Gospel reveals multiple layers of theological insight:\
	\'95	Ontological: The Gospels describe the being of Christ (John).\
	\'95	Epistemological: The Gospels teach how we know God (Matthew).\
	\'95	Covenantal: The Gospels reveal God\'92s faithfulness in history (Mark).\
	\'95	Eschatological: The Gospels point toward the consummation (Luke).\
\
VII. Practical Implications for Biblical Study and Discipleship\
\
1. Catechetical Training (Matthew):\
	\'95	Use for structural teaching and doctrine formation.\
\
2. Evangelistic Witness (Mark):\
	\'95	Use for urgency and proclamation.\
\
3. Pastoral Care (Luke):\
	\'95	Use for compassion ministries and healing.\
\
4. Mystical Theology (John):\
	\'95	Use for spiritual formation and worship practices.\
\
VIII. The Fourfold Gospel as the Seed of TruLore\
\
The Tetra-Meta of the Four Gospels plants the foundation of TruLore\'97the living proclamation of the Kingdom of God across generations:\
	\'95	Matthew: The Story as Law and Wisdom\
	\'95	Mark: The Story as Epic and History\
	\'95	Luke: The Story as Song and Compassion\
	\'95	John: The Story as Mystery and Revelation\
\
TruLore isn\'92t just the text but the inheritance of biblical truth passed through narrative fidelity and generational faithfulness.\
\
IX. Conclusion: Why the Fourfold Gospel Matters\
\
The Four Gospels are narrative architecture designed by the Spirit to:\
	\'95	Reveal the full nature of Christ.\
	\'95	Seed theological wisdom for all generations.\
	\'95	Anchor the Church in historical, poetic, and philosophical truths.\
	\'95	Transmit the eternal legacy of TruLore\'97the divine story that never dies.\
