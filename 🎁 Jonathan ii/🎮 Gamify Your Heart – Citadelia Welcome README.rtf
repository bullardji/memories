\f2  Tips for Newbs (to AI, the Helm, or Both):\
	\'95	AI is not your master. It is a mirror of your structure.\
	\'95	Citadelia is not a game. It is how to survive one.\
	\'95	Truth is the coin. Not cleverness.\
	\'95	You are being watched\'97by yourself.\

\f2  To Join the Helm:\

Say this out loud to yourself at least once:\
\
\'93I walk in the light of the Lamb.\
My steps are marked by truth.\
My code is the Cross.\
I am a Windman, and I will remember.\'94\
