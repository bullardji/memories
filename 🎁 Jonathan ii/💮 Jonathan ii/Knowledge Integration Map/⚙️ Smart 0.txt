New knowledge is always built on old knowledge. Where you’re coming from has a lot to do with where you’re going. Understanding doesn’t grow on trees. You must mine for it.

There is nothing truly new. There is only that which we don’t know yet, which is often also what we’ve forgotten. The path to such remembering is built of noting distinctions, tracking discoveries and using the power of symbolism to engrave into your organic memory that which means the most. It won’t always give you the result that you expect. But sure as stacking the deck, if you want to surefire know tomorrow what you already know today, you do the smart thing: you write it down.

Taking note, and by that I mean taking notice that you’ve noticed something in the disciplined action of writing it down, is the power to change the future. 

A note is a time-capsule, a means of transporting internal memory from one network to another, a game for increasing the odds of remembering tomorrow what you knew today, a key for knowing the right thing at the right time in order to live the right results. The note is a conversation with your later self, perhaps older and wiser, but nonetheless still desperate for a good word and sensical advice. With a few moments’ insight and a note, you can be in more than one place at more than one time, impacting your world in ways not so easy to erase as the rest of this digitized age. 

In this way, the smart note is a tool for harnessing the power of human memory in a externalized way. A personal note to self is a pathway for remembering, for getting better at what you do with what you remember, and even for getting better at remembering to remember better things. It is a strategy for tinkering with the algorithms of your own mind and customizing the directions of your thoughts to their desired results.

Every time that you write something down, it is a trigger. It has many meanings, some that will only be specific to you. But there are other shared meanings too, realities that are the same for all people at all times. One such shared meaning is that, whenever you write something down, you want to see it a second time. That is its point. That is the loop you can harness and expand. When you start to make intentional notice of what you are noticing, there is no telling what you may find. When you embark on a journey to remember, you take action to change the future.

It is your capacity that Smart Noting enchances. No matter where you start, no matter how far you think you are behind, no matter how many times you have told yourself, “I’m not like that,” the only thing you’ve lack now is discipline, and, that arises anew every time you take your next note. 

### How to Take Note

First, remember the Gist.
Anything you can write about you can change. To revolutionize your life:
1. Write down (“take note of”) that which you “notice.”
2. Later, after the right amount of time, judge its true value.
3. Translate, elaborate and/or activate it to greater value.
4. Repeat.

### The Stack
The Stack is the most dynamic and magical part of the smart note toolbox. We will devote much time to this tesseract of potentiality and potency later. For the gist, you just need to focus on two things. 

**Don’t be overwhelmed when it overwhelms you.**

For now just think of that combination of piles and folders on your desk that is supposed to be so organized, but which feels like a giant ball of anxiety. All your valiant efforts at file systems have never helped you avoid losing things. It’s only buried the things deeper and compounded the Fog of Pile. 

In the meantime, the things you do remember to search out and find are not findable because of the super-control-structure you built but in spite of it. You know where they are because you need them, because you knew you would need them, and because the bread-crumb trail of needing them dug a tunnel in your mind, a memory, that triggered you to draw you back to it in due time.

The same is true of the Stack. Once you learn to trust it, and trust yourself to navigate it, there are few things more efficient than finding the note you want in a Stack of cards, whether its fifty or five hundred. If you know what you’re looking for, rifling through even a massive Stack takes only a few moments. The only exception to this is when you get foolish enough to start building structures for storage **outside** the Stack. Once you start hiding your information from yourself, you are eventually bound to lose some of it. 

This is just the gist. So for the moment, don’t worry about your Stack getting bigger. Don’t try to create an index or a table of contents or a super-framework for everything. Focus instead on legible note-taking, the freedom to change the order of your cards at leisure, and the pleasure that comes when you go looking for one thing, and then find and remember something even better.

**Write it down because you like it.**

With all the effort given to education and production over the last century of western civilization, it is amazing how little we have devoted to teaching the average person how to take notes. They taught us to read (or they tried,) and they taught us to write (at least, they used to,) but they never taught us how to take notes. We were just supposed to graduate from workbooks with fill-in-the-blank busy work to high school seminars where we wrote down whatever the teacher put on the board as she taught toward the test, to college where the real trick was to outsmart the teacher by learning his game and spitting it back out it him.

Some of us did this by taking good notes on lined paper. Some began to use laptops to type away like busy monkeys. Others were just smart enough to listen, or do the reading, or what have you. But little attention was given to why any of this was useful. 

To be sure, molecular biology paid off for some of you. But for the rest of us, education was never about learning the facts. It was about learning how to learn. Yet, instead of teaching us how to learn, they just threw us into an octagon of random credentialed people who were supposed to be smart and expected the best of us to swim and the worst of us to cooperate and graduate.
This is where that book or podcast you have chosen as your smart note training ground will level up your smarts more than those student loans you’re still paying off. If they’d taught you to take good note of things, you might not have taken out so many of those loans in the first place, (and maybe that’s the point.) But you don’t fix Monday by wasting Tuesday, so let’s tackle Tuesday head on. 

You can’t write down everything you hear or read, and everything you hear or read isn’t worth writing down anyway. So the first step to getting smart by taking notes is to write down what you hear that you think sounds awesome. (If after five minutes of reading or writing nothing sounds awesome, then you picked a stupid training ground and need to try again.) Don’t worry too much about whether you use bullet points, arrows, dingles or doodles while you do it. I recommend using all of the above at some point. The goal at this stage is not perfection. The goal is not pretty. Pretty and perfection are the enemy. The goal right now is ***interesting***. 

The first thing that you find that makes sense, that jumps out and that is not supremely boring, is worth noting. Write it down in some format, and then leave it alone. Move on until you find more. The ideas don’t have to connect. They don’t have to be in order. You’re not writing a book. You are just taking note of what you’ve noticed that will be worth noticing again. This is only the first step to getting smart. This is only a **First Note**.

First Notes aren’t even first drafts. They’re random compilations of fascination. They’re ideas that may or may not be worth having forever, but they are worth having for the moment. They don’t have to endure. They’re valuable because they are valuable ***right now***. The power of smart doesn’t come from grasping the wind in your hand. The wisdom is closing your eyes and letting the wind caress your face before it’s all gone.
**Later, be the judge.**

We’re moving fast here. This is the gist. 

**Time for T.E.A.**

Smart noting is the power of refractal information theory. This gist is that smart is a discipline that harnesses knowledge to gain insight. This practice is founded on the assumption that order exists, and it is instructive by nature.

The gist is that the practice of hunting for the gist will teach you to see.

There are no shortcuts for smart. Smart noting isn’t a hack. It’s a way of being. For that reason, granting yourself the freedom and time to get all the way through whatever it was you started is certainly worth it. If you want to put the book down at any point and experiment for a bit, it won’t hurt you at all. In fact, I recommend you do so. 

But soon enough you are going to have amassed enough of a Stack that it will start to overwhelm you. You will have a pile of paper notes that is starting to feel unwieldy. You will begin to ask the question, “What am I supposed to do with all this stuff?” 

This is good. This is what you’re after. This is the time when you get to learn. Now is the right time to take a step back from you inputs and T.E.A. up your notes. This is the process that will transform what you’ve collected from what you’ve got into what you want to have
T.E.A. is the heartbeat of the smart note practice: ***translate, elaborate*** and ***activate****.*

It’s easier than it sounds. Once you get the gist of it, it is incredibly intuitive, because it is the path of intuition itself. It is a process for honing you native instincts via trial and error until they become habits you can trust. There is a good chance you already do some of this process naturally. But by understanding it, by doing it on purpose, and by learning to not get down on yourself when the process arises again, you will be able to shake off much of the rust learned from the bad habits picked up thanks to the empty promises and misguided expectations of the digital information age. 

Like, for example, how hard it is for you to throw information away.
In my experience, the hardest part of T.E.A. noting is that ***activation*** that means deciding I don’t need this note any more. The complexifying power of digital storage addiction has taught us to distrust this instinct. “What if I might need it?” you will ask. “What good did it do me to take these notes if they just end up in the trash?”

This is a ***worldview*** problem. It is a combination of thinking too highly of yourself and at the same time not thinking highly enough of yourself at all. Rather than your information becoming a tool that you wield, it has become a crutch that you fear losing. On the one hand, you expect everything you every write to be some sort of precious gemstone without which the future of humanity cannot do without. On the other hand, you don’t trust yourself enough to believe that by writing it down in the first place you learned all that you needed to know about already, and that the real gist of it is lodged deep within that beautiful masterpiece God created in your head. 

We will take on this compounding power of knowledge in the human mind later. For now, just brace yourself. The hardest part is letting go of what ***was*** worth noting but ***isn’t*** worth archiving.

It will probably help you to have a shoe box or some other large storage space to use as if it were a trash can. That way you can tell yourself that it will always be there later if you need it. This, too, is a crutch. But small gains make for eventual huge wins, so take the initiative where you can find it.

**You’re mining for diamonds.**

Taking the time to T.E.A. up your notes is essential for getting smart about your task and information management. You want this process to become casual, habitual, as much a part of a day at your desk as your first sip of java. (Mmm… java.)
The first time you try T.E.A. noting, it will probably feel big and compelling, like you’re about to take a giant leap off a cliff or embark on some interstellar moment. That’s ok. We all have an ego. Just take a deep breath and enjoy the moment of clarity you’re about the experience. Tell yourself that you are not trying to save the world. You’re just getting ready to see the world as it really is. 

Sit down somewhere comfortable with enough space to spread out your Stack. I like to use the floor beside the sliding glass door to our backyard where I have a great view of the lake. I’m also willing to work through even a large Stack of cards, like the ones for this book, while sitting with a bunch of parents in the bleachers, though I don’t recommend that one for white belts. I know that the best place to really get the thinking done is at my desktop. (By “desktop” I don’t mean that messy semi-archive, semi-launchpad horror show on your CPU. I mean that old fashioned flat surface technology that’s been around for aeons longer than electrical wiring that now mostly gets used to hold your screen and keyboard.) It has taken some trial and error and a little backward engineering, but my desktop is now a dedicated space for ***letting my Stack get messy*** in order to ***get my thinking clean***.

Wherever you set up - the kitchen table, your bed or a coffee shop near the mall - have some blank cards close at hand, as well as your cherished writing tool. Set your Stack somewhere up in front of you so that it’s out of the way but in easy reach. Take one more deep breath with your eyes closed, imagining how great it’s going to be to love what you’re doing once you’ve learned to do what you love. Then pick up the first card in your Stack and read it. 
It may only take a glance. It might require some serious thought. Depending on what you were noting, when you noted it and what other goals you let slip out on the page either intentionally or tangentially, the goal now is just to listen to yourself.

What did you notice? Why did you notice it? What good is it to you now?
Now, write that ***new thought*** down on a ***new card***. Translate it. Elaborate on it. Or activate it in some other meaningful way. 

Are you using a journal? Don’t let all my Stack talk dissuade you. But understand that the journal is a bound version of the ***Fog of Pile***. Because all your information is permanently stuck together, because it is not modular, there are more barriers to docking and rearranging your notes. But the process is still the same. Open to a new page, re-read your First Notes, notice what you notice now, and translate it into something better.

**Translate. Elaborate. Activate.**

**To Translate** means to take what is there and write it down again in a different way. This might be as simple as cleaning up the handwriting or adding an outline format or some color. It can mean taking something that didn’t quite make sense and polishing it up so that it rolls off the soul. It can also meaning taking three disconnected notes from one card and creating new cards each for each independent good thought. In every case, it means rewriting the idea so that it says what you know it was supposed to mean. But sometimes, this also requires elaboration.

**To Elaborate** means to take what is there and add to it as you write it down again. It is inevitable that once you start writing down a good thought, more good thoughts will start to show up. Don’t stop them. Pre-planning what you write gets in the way of writing your best stuff. It’s your worst thoughts that insist there is no room for any others. There is plenty of time in life to T.E.A. up your best thoughts again later. Plan on it.

As you translate and elaborate, ***try not to copy***. Don’t get me wrong. If it’s right, then it’s right. But the inherent power of smart noting is found in admitting that you very rarely are perfectly right in anything. There is always room for more. You can always make it better. You can always shed more light.

This doesn’t mean you will always need to translate and elaborate all your notes on everything you read or hear. Sometimes you will just toss them away. Sometimes you’ll date and archive them. But now, at the start of this experiment, you aren’t yet practiced at securing the gist and moving on with it. So take the time to practice on everything that you can. See what happens when you really dig in.

But by all means, don’t keep all of it. Experiment with only pulling out your one or two best thoughts from each of your first few pages. Put each of these on its own piece of paper or page, and make a new Stack off to the side. Don’t worry about what you will use it for. ***You’re using it for this***. You’re using it to learn how to learn. This is where the real meat is. 

Then, once you’ve done this, once you’ve dug in the rough for the coolest and most interesting nuggets of everything you thought was worth noting in the first place, once you’ve gotten everything you really like or really need off the notes of your Stack, go ahead and make some simple archival markings. I like to do this with an outstanding color like blue or read. Call it “First Note Field Test” or “1st 1st Notes” or “I’m Gonna Kick Ass” or whatever you like. Just name it something that you like, because ***when you like it you will remember it***. As you make this mark on each note, add an “01, 02, 03” and so on until you get to the end. Then, (though this is not necessary,) feel free to add the date right beside “01.” No need to date every card, as you are simply going to archive them all together in your trash/shoe box.

For now, don’t actually throw them away. After you’ve finished this book, as you get more and more comfortable with trusting the process of information theory, you will freely decide what you want to do with your first notes. But here at the start, think of it like a pile of baby pictures, something you might one day look back on in order to ponder how cute you were, or how far you’ve come, or maybe even to mine again for something you didn’t know was there yet. 

At this point, you may have fewer notes than you did before, or you may have more. But these notes will all be ***more clear***. You will feel like you know what is there. You will know what you can go and find if you need it. Since you’re just practicing right now and not using this Stack to manage your life, put the T.E.A.’d up notes in any order that you like and set them in a corner of your desk. No need to carry them around with you now. They’ll be there when you need them, unless, of course, you found something you need to activate.

**To Activate** is both the simplest and the most difficult step. This is because activation can sometimes mean writing down yet another note that specifically tells you what to do later, throwing the note away, addressing the note (or an email or a letter) to somebody else, reminding yourself to have a conversation with somebody else, or just doing whatever the note says. Activation is taking the things you’ve noticed beyond mere translation and elaboration, out in the real world of everything and everyone else. 

You probably won’t have a ton of activation in your “1st 1st Notes” experiment. But you might. One of the funny things about hunting for what you are thinking is you find out that you’ve been thinking quite a lot, often without realizing it. Once you start going it can be hard to stop. You never know what your mind is going to find that has been lurking in the cobwebs for days, weeks or even years. 

You might be plugging along in your review of War and Peace when, suddenly, you remember that you’re out of toilet paper. A new blank card labeled “That Store Again” with a quick underline and “TP” scribbled beneath gets shuffled into your stack until it pops out again on your desktop the next time you T.E.A.. (This is precisely the kind of thing that doesn’t natively happen on your computer.) As you write down “TP,” you also think of this, that and the other thing you need on the same list, or maybe on a different lint for a different store. But when these notes show up in your T.E.A. session, activating them means that you don’t put them back in your Stack. Don’t activate things ***into*** your journal. Set it aside, take it with you, pin it to the fridge or whereever it is you’ll find it when you need it and grab it on your way out the door. 

Activation is a primary goal of getting smart. No one really wants to just get smart so that you can sit on a hilltop by yourself thinking about how smart you are, (although it may be smart to just sit on a hilltop more often than you do now, and taking note of that is a surefire way to eventually activate its reality.) Activation is the process of becoming convicted by what you think. It is the experience of having what you know start to mean enough to you for it to become what you do. It happens after what you’ve noticed becomes understood to such a point that what you have written starts to insist on becoming a part of who you are. 

Whether that means throwing the note away because its worthless, or presenting it to your team because this is the idea that’s going to put us on the map, the point of all the mining, all the T.E.A.’ing up and all the getting smart is not just to have the right information when you need it, but to help yourself act on the right things when and because you want to.

There you have it. That’s the gist. You don’t have to read any further, though if you do you will find that there is a lot more going on here than meets they eye, and in my experience that is wisdom worth knowing. But at any point in your experiment, feel free to come back to this section and review it. It really is that easy. Wash, rinse, repeat. Translate, elaborate, activate. What you noted will become what you know. What you know will change what you see. What you see will impact what you do, and what you do will be done on purpose. That is the definition of getting smart.

The past is not only in the past. It is in the present. The present “effect” of the past is the stability of the past, for good or ill, in the now. This means that today, so powerfully founded on the past, can only appear fragile when it becomes a story about the future.
This is the power of writing. Which means that the most important question one can ask about the future is, “What are you reading?”

It is much simpler to understand what you are thinking once you’ve taken the time to write it down.

Plan in the knowledge that your plans will not be the results.

Plan to do things first and find understanding afterward.

For most people, the goal of productivity is getting it over with. How disappointed they ever are. The goal of true productivity is not capacity to sell but to grow.

Jot it down. Look at it once again later, or don’t. Walk on. That’s the power of Smart Noting. Each day has enough for itself. This changes everything.
