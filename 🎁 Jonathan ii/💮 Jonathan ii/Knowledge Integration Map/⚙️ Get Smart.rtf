	2.	Set Goals, Shift Reality: Goals aren\'92t just targets; they reprogram how you engage the present. When you aim high, you act differently\'97today.\
	3.	Goals Shape Perception: The goals you choose define the lens you see life through. Set them wisely, because they control the narrative in your head.\
	4.	Keep It Real: Unrealistic goals kill momentum. Achievable targets? They build unstoppable energy.\
	5.	Simplicity Wins: Complexity multiplies failure. Simple strategies? They cut through the noise and deliver results.\
	6.	Flexibility is Power: Over-planning suffocates creativity. Stay adaptable. Rigidity is the enemy of progress.\
	7.	Linearity is a Lie: Progress isn\'92t a straight line. Life doesn\'92t wait for perfect steps\'97move now with what you have.\
	8.	Principle Over Process: Core truths scale\'97whether you\'92re leading a team, building a life, or facing a crisis. Master the fundamentals and they work everywhere.\

This is More Than a System\'97It\'92s a Mindset Shift:\
This isn\'92t just theory\'97it\'92s a total recalibration of how you make decisions. The Smart Kernel refines clarity under pressure. It rejects micromanagement and fear-driven control. This is faith in action:\
	\'95	Faith Over Control: Trust the process. Control is an illusion. Faith-driven action has been the blueprint for victory since the beginning\'97ask Gideon, ask David, ask Christ.\
	\'95	Wisdom That Scales: The truth works. Principles aren\'92t bound by context\'97they thrive in every setting. That\'92s what makes Scripture timeless.\
	\'95	Now, Not Someday: The power is in the present. Stop worrying about tomorrow. Do what you can now. Jesus said it best: \'93Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.\'94 (Matthew 6:34)\
\
