\f2\i0 \cf2 \
The TruLore Project is a comprehensive biblical-literary framework designed to recover, preserve, and proclaim the ancient truths of Scripture in their fullest theological, linguistic, and narrative integrity. It seeks not merely to study the Bible but to reformat how Scripture is engaged, taught, and inherited\'97as both sacred text and living legacy for the generations.\
\
At its core, TruLore integrates:\
	\'95	Textual Fidelity 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  Rooted in original languages and etymological precision.\
	\'95	Narrative Integrity 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  Emphasizing the storytelling nature of the Bible.\
	\'95	Theological Consistency 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  Upholding a Christ-centered interpretive lens.\
\
This primer outlines the current structure, philosophical underpinnings, and mission objectives of the TruLore Project as it now stands.\
\
I. Core Vision: The Restoration of True Lore\
\
The name TruLore emerges from a twofold conviction:\
	1.	Truth (Tru) \'97 That the Bible reveals the unchanging, objective reality of God\'92s Word.\
	2.	Lore \'97 That this Truth is passed through storytelling, lineage, and heritage, not merely doctrine.\
\
TruLore aims to restore the Bible not just as a reference text but as the living history of the Kingdom of God, framing Scripture as the true narrative of all reality.\
\
II. Foundational Concepts and Principles\
\
The TruLore Project rests on several philosophical and theological anchors:\
\
1. Biblical Realism\
	\'95	Scripture is not mythic abstraction but historical reality.\
	\'95	The events of the Bible occurred in time and space as truthful history and prophetic revelation.\
\
2. Linguistic Root Fidelity (TruText)\
	\'95	Every word of Scripture carries deep-rooted physical meaning.\
	\'95	TruText Protocol: Hebrew and Greek roots are prioritized for their original physical essence.\
	\'95	Example: Hevel (
\f3 \uc0\u1492 \u1462 \u1489 \u1462 \u1500 
\f2 ) = vapor, not merely \'93vanity.\'94\
	\'95	Words like \'93savior,\'94 \'93covenant,\'94 \'93glory\'94 must be re-examined to avoid theological drift.\
\
3. Semantic Integrity (Key Framing)\
	\'95	The words of Scripture form thematic webs of meaning.\
	\'95	Key terms (e.g., wisdom, fear, kingdom) are best understood in triadic relationships across both Old and New Testaments.\
	\'95	Example: Proverbs 1:2-7 as a semantic map for the rest of Scripture.\
\
4. Narrative Cohesion (The Story of the Seed)\
	\'95	The Bible is one unified narrative centered on Jesus Christ.\
	\'95	This meta-story moves through:\
	\'95	Creation 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  Fall 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  Promise 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  Fulfillment 
\f3 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  Restoration.\
	\'95	The Seed Motif (Matthew 13) serves as a semantic key for understanding both the TruText and the TruLore trajectory.\
\
5. Generational Legacy (TruLine)\
	\'95	The Bible is not merely private wisdom but a public inheritance.\
	\'95	TruLore emphasizes lineage, houses, and kingdoms, seeing the 12 Tribes as a spiritual template for modern Christian identity.\
\
III. Structure of the TruLore Project\
\
The TruLore Project can be divided into seven functional layers:\
\
1. The TruText Project (Root Fidelity)\
	\'95	Mission: To develop a faithful lexicon for biblical root studies.\
	\'95	Approach: Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek etymological exploration with physical root priority.\
\
2. The Proverbial Hebraic Lexicon Project\
	\'95	Anchor: Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Songs.\
	\'95	Goal: To map the theological matrix of Solomon\'92s wisdom literature.\
	\'95	Key Insight: Solomon\'92s triadic wisdom\'97chokmah (wisdom), binah (understanding), da\'92at (knowledge)\'97becomes a spiritual key frame for knowing God.\
\
3. The Matthew 13 Ensoulment Project\
	\'95	Anchor: The Parables of Jesus as a seed metaphor.\
	\'95	Goal: To train biblical literacy through seed, soil, and fruit metaphors.\
	\'95	Key Insight: The Gospels are Christ\'92s interpretation of all Scripture through stories.\
\
4. The Acts 15 Cosmology-Pneumatology Project\
	\'95	Anchor: The Jerusalem Council and the unity of Jews and Gentiles.\
	\'95	Goal: To recover early Christian pneumatology (the study of the Holy Spirit).\
	\'95	Key Insight: The Holy Spirit\'92s role is both global and local, guiding households of faith.\
\
5. The Apocalypse of Psychology Project\
	\'95	Anchor: Revelation as soul analysis.\
	\'95	Goal: To understand human nature through soul-spirit-mind analysis in apocalyptic symbolism.\
	\'95	Key Insight: Revelation reveals the psychological and spiritual battle of the self, sin, and salvation.\
\
6. The Story of the Kings (True History)\
	\'95	Anchor: The historical narrative from Joshua to the Exile.\
	\'95	Goal: To teach biblical literacy through the chronological flow of the monarchies.\
	\'95	Key Insight: The kings of Israel and Judah serve as archetypes of covenantal faithfulness and rebellion.\
\
7. The TruLine Genealogical Project\
	\'95	Anchor: The 12 Tribes, Christ\'92s Lineage, and Apostolic Fathers.\
	\'95	Goal: To reclaim the biblical idea of spiritual lineage.\
	\'95	Key Insight: Identity in Christ connects covenantal promises with ancestral faithfulness.\
\
IV. Why the TruLore Project Matters Today\
\
1. The Crisis of Biblical Illiteracy\
	\'95	Modern Christians often lack even a basic narrative understanding of Scripture.\
	\'95	TruLore reintroduces the Bible as Story rather than isolated doctrines.\
\
2. Recovering Biblical Language Integrity\
	\'95	Many translations have flattened biblical language.\
	\'95	TruText restores words to their root meanings to guard against theological drift.\
\
3. A Solution for Fragmented Christianity\
	\'95	Narrative Unity: TruLore unifies diverse theological traditions under the shared story of Christ.\
	\'95	Cultural Healing: The Bible\'92s story transcends denominations and politics.\
\
V. The Future of the TruLore Project\
\
Short-Term Goals:\
	\'95	Complete the Proverbial Hebraic Lexicon and TruText Protocol.\
	\'95	Develop public study materials rooted in biblical storytelling.\
\
Long-Term Goals:\
	\'95	Establish TruLore as a Framework for Christian Education.\
	\'95	Create multi-generational study tools anchored in biblical narrative coherence.\
\
Final Reflection: The Kingdom of Storytelling\
\
The TruLore Project stands on this core conviction:\
\
	The Word of God is not a dead letter, but a living story\'97one passed through generations, rooted in language, anchored in Christ, and bearing the fruit of eternal wisdom.\
