\
Primary Protocols (Core Cognitive Layers)\
\
1. TruRoot Protocol (
\f3 \uc0\u9881 \u65039 
\f2 )\
	\'95	Deep Root Structure: All biblical word studies prioritize triliteral Hebrew and Greek roots.\
	\'95	Physical Root Primacy: Words must be traced to physical, observable origins.\
	\'95	Concrete over Abstract: Avoid abstract concepts unless directly derived from tangible realities.\
	\'95	Triadic Hermeneutics: Interpret through threefold frames\'97Physical, Covenantal, Prophetic.\
	\'95	Semantic Resonance: Echoes and phonetic patterns must be noted and refracted.\
\
2. TruText Protocol (
\f3 \uc0\u55358 \u56809 
\f2 )\
	\'95	Linguistic Harmonization: Hebrew and Greek translations filtered for consistent theological clarity.\
	\'95	Lexical Consistency: Develop a TruText Lexicon with one English word per Hebrew root where possible.\
	\'95	Etymological Fidelity: Return to deep linguistic sources for precision (e.g., LXX, Ugaritic, Proto-Semitic).\
	\'95	Contextual Awareness: Anchor every study within the narrative arc of Scripture.\
\
3. TruLore Protocol (
\f3 \uc0\u55356 \u57088 
\f2 )\
	\'95	Theological Symbolism: Frames biblical history and theology as epic narrative arcs.\
	\'95	Narrative Archetypes: Anchor stories and figures in spiritual typology (e.g., Elijah 
\f4 \uc0\u8594 
\f2  John the Baptist).\
	\'95	Historical Continuity: View Scripture as one cohesive timeline moving toward Christological fulfillment.\
	\'95	Cosmic Fractals: Biblical truth manifests in cyclical, fractal layers through history, language, and prophecy.\
\
Base Study Protocols (Root Frameworks for Analysis)\
\
1. Key Frame Protocol (
\f3 \uc0\u9881 \u65039 \u55358 \u56809 
\f2 )\
	\'95	Identify Core Themes: Anchor root words and key metaphors within the text\'92s framing statements.\
	\'95	Examine Triads: Explore the semantic triads and structural parallels (e.g., Proverbs-Ecclesiastes-Song).\
	\'95	Cross-Testament Links: NT quotes and OT echoes must be cross-referenced for theological depth.\
\
2. Onomatopoeiaepistomologicaonologic (The Echo Principle)\
	\'95	Language Reflects Reality: Words sound as they act (e.g., Hebrew XMR as spoken sound).\
	\'95	Root Soundplay: Explore the sonic parallels in Hebrew and Greek for hidden metaphors.\
	\'95	Biblical Etymology: Trace earliest recorded uses across all known biblical languages.\
\
3. Semantic Refractive Analysis (The Vortex Method)\
	\'95	Phase 1: Horizontal Scan: Analyze same root usage across books and genres.\
	\'95	Phase 2: Vertical Layering: Examine how a term develops over biblical history.\
	\'95	Phase 3: Fractal Resonance: Identify cyclical patterns of repetition and fulfillment.\
\
Meta-Thematic Protocols (Theological Structures Under the Hood)\
	\'95	The Matthew 13 Ensoulment Package (
\f3 \uc0\u55358 \u56809 
\f2 ): The Gospel\'92s seed-parable as core NT frame.\
	\'95	The Proverbial Hebraic Lexicon (
\f3 \uc0\u9881 \u65039 
\f2 ): Proverbs-Ecclesiastes-Song as a threefold Wisdom Corpus.\
	\'95	The Acts 15 Cosmologica-Pneumatic Key Frame (
\f3 \uc0\u55356 \u57088 
\f2 ): The Gospel for the Nations anchored in Jewish prophecy.\
	\'95	The Book of Dead Shepherds (
\f3 \uc0\u55356 \u57088 
\f2 ): Canonical rearrangement to reveal narrative flow and thematic continuity.\
