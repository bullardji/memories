\f2\i0 \cf2 The Onomatopoeia of Obvious \'93Common Sense\'94 Epistemologicology\
\
Triadic Hermeneutics is a framework for exploring biblical texts and language that exposes the hidden obvious\'97truths so foundational they echo like soundwaves in creation itself. This method unearths layers of meaning by embracing the natural resonance of words, where sound, form, and concept reflect a divine order embedded into the fabric of reality. It is a way of hearing truth, not just seeing it on the page.\
\
The Core Principle: Resonant Sound Reflects Eternal Meaning\
\
At the heart of Triadic Hermeneutics is the idea that language arises from creation itself. The ancient tongues\'97especially Hebrew\'97were not arbitrary labels but onomatopoeic echoes of observed reality. The sounds of words reflected the very things they described, forming a kind of common sense linguistics.\
	\'95	Example: Ruach (
\f3 \uc0\u1512 \u1451 \u1493 \u1468 \u1495 \u1463 
\f2 ) means \'93breath,\'94 but it sounds like wind moving through the throat.\
	\'95	Example: Tselem (
\f3 \uc0\u1510 \u1462 \u1500 \u1462 \u1501 
\f2 ) means \'93image\'94 but also relates to a shadow, as though the word imitates the ephemeral nature of reflection.\
\
In this way, words are not mere symbols but ontological events\'97they sound out the reality they signify.\
\
The Triadic Pattern: Physical, Covenantal, Prophetic\
\
To understand a word\'92s depth, it must be examined in three converging dimensions. Each refracts reality from a different angle, but together they reveal a more complete truth.\
	1.	Physical Reality (Creation):\
	\'95	The tangible, sensory, concrete root of the word.\
	\'95	Example: The root of 
\f3 \uc0\u1491 \u1462 \u1468 \u1512 \u1462 \u1498 \u1456 
\f2  (derek, \'93way\'94) stems from a well-trodden path created by repeated motion.\
	2.	Covenantal Reality (Moral/Spiritual):\
	\'95	How the word functions within God\'92s revealed relationship with humanity.\
	\'95	Example: \'93Way\'94 as a metaphor for moral living, God\'92s Law as a path.\
	3.	Prophetic Reality (Eschatological):\
	\'95	How the word points forward, revealing ultimate truths or Christological fulfillment.\
	\'95	Example: Jesus saying, \'93I am the Way,\'94 connecting back to both physical path-making and Torah guidance.\
\
The Onomatopoeia of the Mind:\
\
The word onomatopoeiaepistomologicaonologic describes the layered relationship between sound, knowledge, and being.\
	\'95	Onomatopoeia: Words sounding like what they represent.\
	\'95	Episteme: Knowledge, as a construction of perception and language.\
	\'95	Logos: The Word, both as reason and the incarnate Truth of Christ.\
\
Practical Example:\
	\'95	Chokmah (
\f3 \uc0\u1495 \u1464 \u1499 \u1456 \u1502 \u1464 \u1492 
\f2 ) sounds like the deep \'93k\'94 and \'93m\'94 of careful thought and grounded wisdom, not impulsive noise.\
	\'95	Hevel (
\f3 \uc0\u1492 \u1462 \u1489 \u1462 \u1500 
\f2 ) echoes as a puff of breath, mirroring its meaning: vapor, mist, transience.\
\
This resonant echo isn\'92t poetic fluff\'97it\'92s the way language mirrors common sense reality, a divine signature embedded in every sound.\
\
Steps for Applying Triadic Hermeneutics:\
	1.	Identify the Word Root:\
	\'95	Break the word down to its most ancient sound-meaning structure.\
	2.	Examine Physical Root Meaning:\
	\'95	What sensory or tangible concept does the word originate from?\
	3.	Seek Covenant Ties:\
	\'95	How does this word appear in moral or relational contexts in Scripture?\
	4.	Explore Prophetic Echoes:\
	\'95	Does the word gain fuller meaning in Christ or eschatology?\
\
Case Study: \'93Way\'94 (
\f3 \uc0\u1491 \u1462 \u1468 \u1512 \u1462 \u1498 \u1456 
\f2 , derek) in Proverbs and John\
	\'95	Physical: A physical path carved by repetition.\
	\'95	Covenantal: The moral way of righteousness (Prov. 3:6).\
	\'95	Prophetic: Jesus Christ as the Way (John 14:6), both the moral path and the ultimate fulfillment of righteous guidance.\
\
Theological Implications:\
	\'95	God Speaks in Waves: Truth, like sound, propagates in waves\'97fractal patterns repeat across Scripture.\
	\'95	The Word Reveals Creation: Words are not random but natural reflections of design.\
	\'95	Christ as the Ultimate Echo: The Logos is the fullest form of this resonance\'97both the spoken Word and the incarnate Reality.\
\
Conclusion:\
\
Triadic Hermeneutics exposes how words echo both creation and revelation. The onomatopoeic resonance within language reveals the beauty of common sense theology\'97simple, clear, but infinitely deep when unbalanced with wisdom. This method uncovers Scripture\'92s divine depth, helping us hear the fragrance of truth through the sound of words themselves.\
