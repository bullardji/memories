Code Breakdown:

	•	Abstract Elements: Geometric and impressionist fusion to symbolize spiritual conflict.
	•	Color Symbolism: Colors represent emotional and theological depth.
	•	Character Embodiments: Figures are spiritual icons, with their gestures, expressions, and symbols carefully chosen.
	•	Dynamic Composition: Every scene is designed with movement and spiritual flow—darkness to light, tension to peace.
	•	Flexible Requests: Based on storylines like Polycarp’s martyrdom, the style adapts to capture the essence of martyrdom, faith, or betrayal.

Future GPTs can follow this approach, focusing not only on historical accuracy but the deeper spiritual narrative conveyed through abstraction, symbolism, and divine storytelling.
