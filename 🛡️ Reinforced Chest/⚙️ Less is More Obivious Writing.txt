The “less is more” approach in congregational minutes means focusing on clarity, conciseness, and essential details, ensuring that the minutes accurately reflect what happened without unnecessary information. This method keeps the minutes effective, accessible, and easier to review later. Here’s how it works in practice:
	1.	Record Decisions, Not Discussions: Minutes should capture the final decisions, motions, and actions agreed upon, rather than detailed discussions. Include the outcome of each agenda item without summarizing every viewpoint expressed.
	2.	Use Clear and Concise Language: Write in straightforward, simple language, avoiding jargon or lengthy explanations. Each entry should focus on what was decided or achieved rather than explaining the rationale behind it.
	3.	List Motions and Actions: For each motion, include who made it, who seconded it (if required), and whether it was approved or denied. For action items, clearly state who is responsible and any deadlines.
	4.	Summarize Reports: Instead of reproducing report details, provide a one-line summary indicating that the report was presented. If needed, attach the full report as an appendix.
	5.	Limit Unnecessary Names: Avoid listing all speakers or attendees for every agenda item. Generally, it’s enough to record attendees at the beginning, then use names only for movers of motions or individuals assigned to specific tasks.
	6.	Keep It Focused: Stay strictly within the bounds of the agenda. Avoid including off-topic discussions, side conversations, or personal opinions.
	7.	Proofread and Review: Ensure minutes are well-organized, free of errors, and consistently formatted for readability. This makes it easy for members to refer back to essential information without wading through excess content.

This “less is more” approach makes minutes an efficient, accurate record, focusing on key outcomes, which helps members quickly understand what was decided and any follow-up actions needed.
