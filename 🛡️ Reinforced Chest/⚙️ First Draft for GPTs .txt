Introduction: Fiction? What Good is It?

I have always wanted to be a fiction author. Throughout my life, this dream never wavered. All my other published works were merely steps toward the promise that someday I would write the stories I’d dreamed of since childhood.

But in 2020, I found myself questioning everything, including this cherished goal. Fiction, particularly “dragon stories,” had become my form of escapism—an idolatry, a crutch that enabled self-imposed slavery. Awakening from such illusions, I committed myself to stand amidst the ruins of the world, to hope, to rebuild. And in this newfound clarity, I had to ask: What good is fiction? What purpose does it serve in a real battle against fragility and in pursuit of the substantial?

The Answer: Fiction Is Truth in Disguise

There is no such thing as fiction.

Every story—whether it’s a historical account, a scientific paper, or a fantasy epic—is a constructed perspective. It communicates truth through the lens of human experience, constrained by the author’s limitations, passions, and biases. Even history is storytelling, shaped by its narrator.

When J.R.R. Tolkien wrote of hobbits, he wasn’t describing something you could measure but something profoundly real in its implications. Symbols, metaphors, and narratives reflect the truths that mathematics and science cannot quantify.

Escapism may threaten our discernment. But stories, well told, teach us to live, think, and feel deeply. They aren’t lies—they’re revelations.

Slay the Demon: Write Without Fear

Every writer fights inner demons—self-doubt, procrastination, fear of failure. Success feels dangerous because it changes us. It forces us to face our inner critic, that necessary but often harsh judge of survival and craft. When this critic turns inward, it paralyzes.

Writing isn’t just an act of creation—it’s a confrontation with ourselves. Our stories inevitably reflect our struggles, our fears, and our hopes. The only way to win is to write despite the voice that whispers, “You can’t.” Slay the demon. Finish the story.

Rules to Begin

Rule #1: First drafts are always both worse than you wish and better than you think.

Rule #2: Your story has a hero, and he has the most at stake.

Rule #3: Someone—or something—wants to stop him.

Thumb Rule: Too many rules will stop you from writing. Keep it simple.

The first draft is your playground. Love it enough to rewrite it. Rewrite it until it speaks what you meant.

First Draft Workshop
	1.	Start with Archetypes:
	•	List your top three heroes, villains, plotlines, and scenes from any medium.
	•	Create three archetypal figures for your story: Hero, Villain, and Muse.
	2.	Sketch Their Hearts:
	•	What is at stake for each?
	•	What can’t they afford to lose?
	•	What must they hunt or protect?
	3.	Meet Your Characters:
	•	Write a scene where Hero, Villain, and Muse confront each other.

Scene Design: Rules of Thumb
	1.	Use scenes and sequentials to move the story forward.
	2.	Create clear goals for every scene.
	3.	End scenes with setbacks to build tension.
	4.	Sequence scenes toward the arc of change.

Good plot is simple. It starts with a hero who faces obstacles, grows through them, and changes as a result. Every conflict—internal, relational, or external—pushes the story toward its climax.

Wallpaper, Prop, and Blinkie

Every scene benefits from three elements:
	1.	Wallpaper: The background detail that sets the scene.
	2.	Prop: The object or obstacle that drives action.
	3.	Blinkie: The flavorful distraction that enriches the moment.

Worldbuilding: Building the Sandbox

Worldbuilding is fun, but it must serve the story. Create consistent laws for your world—its nature, physics, and limits. Don’t overbuild. A story needs only the right details at the right time.

Plot and Subplot

A good story solves one problem only to create another. Subplots support the main plot, providing complications, extensions, and imaginative depth.
	1.	The Arc: Every scene and setback leads toward a climactic moment where the hero must choose and act, revealing his true nature.
	2.	The Twist: Use unexpected revelations to keep your reader engaged.

Editing: Hunting for Gems

Editing is about discovering what’s good in your draft and polishing it. Look for:
	•	Wallpaper: Background texture.
	•	Prop: The pivotal object.
	•	Blinkie: The spark of life.

The Physics of Good Storytelling
	1.	Nothing comes from nothing.
	2.	Ideas have consequences.
	3.	Everything has a weakness.
	4.	Magic must have rules.
	5.	Lies have a half-life.

Character and Conflict

Characters reveal themselves through conflict. Their true nature is what they do under pressure. Develop characters who feel real, with flaws, desires, and contradictions.

The Great Ending

An ending should feel inevitable but surprising. It should resolve the protagonist’s journey, revealing his true nature through the final conflict.

Conclusion: Go Write

Your story is waiting. It is a reflection of your soul’s journey. Trust yourself. Slay your demons. Finish your book. You have what it takes.
