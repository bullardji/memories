PPI Tracking

Priority Framework for Managing Inputs

	1.	Immediate (High Proximity, High ðŸ’«)
	â€¢	Key Focus: Tasks with immediate deadlines, such as weekly sermons or any responsibilities tied directly to this weekâ€™s ministry. These are non-negotiable and must be handled first.
	â€¢	Example: Preparing and delivering the sermon for Trinity 14 this weekend.
	2.	Near-Term (Moderate Proximity, Moderate ðŸ’«)
	â€¢	Key Focus: Projects or tasks that are essential but not as urgent. These typically follow immediately after the completion of high-priority tasks.
	â€¢	Example: Onboarding and organizing Christian parabolic-image-coding to streamline workflow and ensure smooth management of weekly tasks.
	3.	Long-Term (Low Proximity, Low ðŸ’«)
	â€¢	Key Focus: Visionary projects that are important for the future but donâ€™t require immediate action. These can be revisited regularly to ensure they align with your immediate tasks and overall mission.
	â€¢	Example: Development of the Fisk Firm and Trust, including the Cross Purpose Cards and Puzzles business.

Assessment Criteria

	1.	Proximity: How soon is the task or project due? The closer it is to the present, the higher its priority.
	2.	ðŸ’« (PPI - Psychic Pressure Index): Tasks that weigh heavily on your mind and need resolution to reduce mental strain and ensure clear focus on other tasks.
	3.	Impact on Mission: How does this task or project align with your mission to serve God and advance your familyâ€™s legacy? The more it supports your calling and long-term goals, the more attention it requires.
	4.	Resource Stewardship: Consider the resources requiredâ€”time, energy, attentionâ€”and whether they are best allocated to this task in the present moment.

Application of the Framework

	1.	Immediate Task:
	â€¢	Focus entirely on this weekendâ€™s sermon, ensuring it is spiritually nourishing and aligns with the message God has placed on your heart.
	2.	Secondary Task:
	â€¢	Organize Christian parabolic-image-coding to maintain clarity and manage tasks effectively, ensuring that the system supports your weekly and daily routines.
	3.	Tertiary Task:
	â€¢	Continue to develop the Fisk Firm and Trust, but only once immediate and secondary tasks are clear and completed.

Ongoing Review

	â€¢	Daily: Check-in on what tasks need attention today, assess their proximity, and prioritize based on the framework.
	â€¢	Weekly: Evaluate your progress on near-term tasks and adjust your focus as needed.
	â€¢	Monthly: Reflect on long-term goals to ensure they are being nurtured in alignment with your daily work and calling.

This priority framework is designed to help you maintain focus, reduce ðŸ’«, and ensure that each task you engage with is a meaningful step toward fulfilling your mission.
