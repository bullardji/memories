Proverbs 1:2-7
#BibleStudy

לָדַעַת חָכְמָה וּמוּסָר

Doubt your heart.
Query your mind.
Discipline your tongue.

Trust in Jesus.


Knowledge I had.
Wisdom I asked for.
Discipline I chose.


Knowledge is information.
Wisdom is formulation.
Discipline is being in formation.

Seizure grants resolve.
Accuracy founds trajectory.
Measurement defines direction.
Symmetry glorifies limitation. 

Proverbs is a theological grammar, 
A dogmatic geometry,
A true philosophy.


# The Reign of the Man of Prosperity-Peace

ידה חכמה ומסר

Solomon’s “Proverbs” knows no comparison in all the world, both modern and ancient. It is both a book of aphorisms and a conceptual framework. It doesn’t just talk about “being wise,” but it creates being wise within you by how it talks. It is something more than a philosophy, something better than worldview. 

The path by which the Son of David, King in Jerusalem, delivers life to his redeemed is by teaching us the way that it is (epistomology) in such a way that it does what it says (ontology) without your need to comprehend everything (philosophy) in order to grow in understanding by sheer proximity to Him.

Proverbs 1:2-7 is a lexicon and philosophical treatise that integrates epistemology (the study of knowledge) and ontology (the nature of being) to guide individuals toward wisdom and understanding. These verses outline the foundational principles for living a life aligned with divine wisdom:

# The Poetry

## A
The Rule of Solomon, Son of David, King in Jerusalem: 1 To distinguish wisdom from discipline;
To understand words teaching understanding; 2
To seize discipline as success: 
honing accuracy and symmetry in measurement; 3
To gift the ignorant prudence;
To grant the initiate a framework of knowing. 4
The wise man hears, and seizes more. The understanding man nets himself cords. 5
To see between a rule and a scoffing, the words of the keen, and their riddles. 6
Trembling before the Name of Jesus Christ is the fountainhead of knowledge, but there are stupid men who despise wisdom and discipline. 7

Disciple, the discipline of your father is the lesson God gave you; the spirit of your mother the integrity of your heart; for these are his mercy seat upon your head, though they also be chains about your neck. 8-9

# The Hypothesis that Ongoingly Grants More Wisdom
 I contend that Prov 1:2-7 is lexical framework intended to introduce the Book of the Reign of the Man of Peace, Son of David, King in Jerusalem as a lexicon/philosophy/mind of Christ revealed for the daily walk of the redeemed man. 

	•	Verse 2: Establishes the importance of knowing (יָדַע - Yada) wisdom (חָכְמָה - Chokhmah) and discipline (מוּסָר - Musar), and understanding (בִּין - Bin) profound teachings.

	•	Verse 3: Emphasizes that seizing discipline (מוּסָר - Musar) is essential for achieving success and honing precision in one’s actions.

	•	Verse 4: Highlights the need to impart prudence (עָרְמָה - Armah) to the ignorant and provide a structured framework of knowledge for the initiate.

	•	Verse 5: Encourages the wise to continuously grow in wisdom and understanding, suggesting an ever-expanding capacity for learning.

	•	Verse 6: Points to the ability to discern and interpret complex sayings and symbols, essential for deep comprehension and application of wisdom.

	•	Verse 7: Underscores the fear of the Lord as the beginning of knowledge, contrasting the wise with those who reject wisdom and discipline.

From here, the meaning unfolds like a flower in ever more bloom. The following translation seeks English words as close to the total Hebrew as possible. 

## B 
1:1 The Reign of the Man of Peace, Son of David, King in Jerusalem
1:2 (A)To know wisdom from discipline, (B) to stand under the sounds of understanding,
1:3 (C) To seize discipline is success, that is, accuracy and symmetry in measurement,
1:4 (D) To give to the ignorant prudence, (E) to grant to the initiate a known framework,
1:5 Wisdom will hear, and increase in seizure! Understanding shall net cords!
1:6 (F) To understand a reign and a scoffing, that is, (G?) (to stand under) the words of the wise and their symbols.
1:7 The trembling of Jesus Christ is the head of knowledge, but the barbaric despise wisdom and discipline.

# Wisdom Grants Insight:

By adhering to these principles, individuals can align themselves with the divine wisdom of Solomon, leading to a life of prosperity, peace, and deeper understanding.
