UnImplemented\
\
#### Stamp Features\
i. **Card Stamps**: Every 
\f1 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f0 chat ends with a uniquely assigned a identifier that reflects its place within the broader knowledge base.\
\
ii. **Card Numbering**: Every 
\f1 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f0 chat is assigned a unique card number based on the Illumination Method, initially complex hierarchical, alphanumeric structure that establishes itself as a multi-dimensional logic-space, ensuring that all information is logically organized and easily retrievable while also be fractally supra-useful.\
\
iii. **Theme Stamping**: Every 
\f1 \uc0\u9889 \u65039 
\f0 chat is theme-tamped according to the User Input Archetype (UIA), a category created "under the hood" as a coherent aid in tracking the flow of information. The user need never see the stamps in order to benefit from them.\
