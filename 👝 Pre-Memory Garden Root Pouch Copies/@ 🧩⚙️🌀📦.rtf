\f1  (divine ratio, balance, truth) is beyond law-based flow.\
	\'95	There is no true life (
\f3 \'bb\'ee
\f1 ) in rigid law (
\f3 \'b7\'a8
\f1 ) without transcending it.\
\
Conclusion:\
	\'95	#3 may refer to the Law (as in Torah, or even a broader sense of legalism), which brooks no fools because rigid legalism destroys life.\
	\'95	The solution suggests that truth transcends mere legality (Acts 14 and its relation to false worship may be a thematic echo).\

\f0 \uc0\u55357 \u56550 
\f1 ) is insufficient\'97one must see the hidden stream of wisdom beyond the law (
\f3 \'9b\'5d\'bb\'ee\'b7\'a8\'c1\'f7
\f1 ).\
	\'95	The Golden Ratio (
\f2 \uc0\u966 
\f1 ) connects what law alone cannot.\
	\'95	Final Thought: \'93Fools\'94 in this context may be those trapped in pure legalism without understanding the greater structure (perhaps Logos, Word, or Wisdom).\
